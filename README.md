# Update on this awful project
## Turns out there are a bit more things to this than simply coding away
### So, please hold (though, I doubt anybody is....)

# The plan currently is to :
* <strong>Make a conda env where I can install libs needed </strong>
* <strong>READ it first and then install the Flask framework</strong>
* <strong>Install the Spotipy lib</strong><br>
And that is it (i think), then I can get started
